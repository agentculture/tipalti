# assign-to-workforce — fan out a converged plan's waves to parallel agents

The skill is named **`assign-to-workforce`**; the product/CLI it reads is the
**`devague plan waves`** command. (The prior leg — turning a spec into a plan —
is the sibling **`/spec-to-plan`** skill.)

`assign-to-workforce` takes a **converged devague plan** and fans out its
dependency waves to parallel agents (subagents, teammate agents, or generalist
agents) — one agent per task per wave — each working in an **isolated git
worktree**. The main agent merges each completed worktree gated by TDD. The
human owns exactly three gates: the exported spec, the implementation split
plan, and the final PR.

The devague CLI is **never orchestrated by devague itself** — `devague plan
waves` describes the dependency graph (#20); it does not spawn agents, manage
worktrees, mark tasks done, or pick a backend. The fan-out is the *operator's*
job — this skill and the main agent perform it.

## How to run

The entry point is `scripts/assign-to-workforce.sh`. Invoke it from the
repository whose plan you are implementing (plans persist under `.devague/`
in the current directory):

```bash
bash .claude/skills/assign-to-workforce/scripts/assign-to-workforce.sh split-plan [--plan <slug>]
bash .claude/skills/assign-to-workforce/scripts/assign-to-workforce.sh waves    [--plan <slug>] [--json]
bash .claude/skills/assign-to-workforce/scripts/assign-to-workforce.sh help
```

It resolves the CLI portably — an installed `devague` on `PATH` (the normal
case), falling back to `uv run devague` when you are inside the devague
checkout, else an install hint. The `split-plan` subcommand reads
`devague plan waves --json` — the enriched payload (devague#53 t9) that
carries every active task's summary, instruction, acceptance criteria, and
covered targets keyed by task id — and renders the human-facing
implementation split plan: task map (task id, wave, summary verbatim, whether
an instruction is present, acceptance-criteria count), proposed per-task
agent + model assignment, the go/no-go question, and — last — an End state
section that is the verbatim output of `devague plan deliverables` (#70),
degrading to a one-line hint on a `devague` too old to have the verb. The
`waves` subcommand forwards to `devague plan waves` verbatim.

### Usage

| Subcommand | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| `split-plan [--plan S]` | Read `devague plan waves --json` and print the implementation split plan — task map (summary/instruction/acceptance-criteria count, verbatim) with per-task agent + model proposal, go/no-go, and a trailing End state section quoting `devague plan deliverables` verbatim (one-line hint on an older devague) — ready for human go/no-go review. |
| `waves [--plan S] [--json]` | Forward to `devague plan waves [--json]`. Read-only; lists wave batches. On a converged plan exits 0 listing the waves. |
| `help` | Print usage. |

## The full flow

The flow has three human gates and one automated TDD merge loop.

### Human gate 1 — the exported spec

The plan is seeded from a converged frame (`devague plan new --frame <slug>`).
The human reviewed and approved the spec when it was exported by the `/think`
skill. No re-approval needed here — the spec gate is already closed.

### Human gate 2 — the implementation split plan

Before any task is assigned, the main agent presents the **implementation split
plan** for human go/no-go. This is the only gate the human owns at the
implementation stage (per task, the TDD gate is the main agent's).

The split plan contains:

1. **Task map** — every task id, its one-line summary (verbatim), whether it
   carries a working instruction, its acceptance-criteria count, and the wave
   it belongs to — all read straight from `devague plan waves --json` (no
   operator paraphrasing).
2. **Per-task agent + model proposal** — for each task: the proposed agent type
   (subagent / teammate / generalist), the proposed model (e.g. a cheaper/faster
   model for a well-scoped task), and the scope justification (why this task is
   safe to delegate).
3. **Go/no-go question** — explicit human decision: "Approve this split and
   assign the plan to the workforce, or edit it first?"
4. **End state** — the verbatim output of `devague plan deliverables` (#70):
   what the plan actually produces — confirmed after-state claims, terminal
   tasks with acceptance criteria, and surviving open items. Present this to
   the human alongside the go/no-go question, not just the task map — approving
   a fan-out without seeing the world it produces is the gap this closes. On a
   `devague` too old to have the verb, this degrades to a one-line hint naming
   the minimum version instead of failing the split plan.

The human may edit any row (agent type, model, scope) before approving. The
plan is model-agnostic — devague does not pick a backend (#20).

Run `split-plan` to print the proposed table:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/assign-to-workforce/scripts/assign-to-workforce.sh split-plan
```

Do not proceed to fan-out until the human approves the split plan.

### The `waves --json` payload — the single source for every brief

`devague plan waves --json` emits `{"plan": "<slug>", "waves": [[...], ...],
"tasks": {...}}` — the ordered dependency-wave batches plus a top-level
`tasks` object keyed by task id, each entry carrying that task's full working
contract:

```json
{
  "plan": "<slug>",
  "waves": [["t1"], ["t2", "t3"]],
  "tasks": {
    "t1": {
      "summary": "<task summary>",
      "instruction": "<verbatim instruction, or \"\" if none>",
      "acceptance_criteria": ["<criterion>", "..."],
      "covers": ["<c*/h* id>", "..."]
    }
  }
}
```

This one payload is enough to build a per-subagent brief with **no external
context** — no need to also read `devague plan show --json` or the exported
plan-md. `split-plan` reads it to render the task map above; the fan-out step
below reads the same payload to build each task agent's brief. Quote
`summary`, `instruction`, `acceptance_criteria`, and `covers` **verbatim**
into every brief — never paraphrase them. (Documented identically in the
sibling `/spec-to-plan` skill, since both skills consume the same payload —
stay consistent if either changes.)

### Fan-out — one agent per task per wave in isolated worktrees

Once the human approves, the main agent fans out each wave in order:

1. **Create an isolated git worktree** for each task in the current wave:

   ```bash
   git worktree add ../worktrees/agent-<task-id> -b agent/<task-id>
   ```

2. **Spawn a task agent** inside that worktree (using the approved model from
   the split plan), with:
   - The task id, summary, working instruction, acceptance criteria, and
     covered targets as its brief — **quoted verbatim** from `devague plan
     waves --json` (see *The `waves --json` payload* above). No operator
     paraphrasing anywhere in this flow: the plan text *is* the contract the
     user confirmed, and a reworded brief silently drifts from it. If a task
     has no instruction (`""`), say so rather than inventing one.
   - Instruction to work **test-first** (TDD): write the failing test(s) that
     match the acceptance criteria before implementing.
   - Instruction to commit its work to the worktree branch.

3. **Same-wave tasks run in parallel** (within-wave tasks have no
   inter-task dependency; the dependency graph guarantees this). Same-file
   overlap surfaces as a merge conflict at reconcile time, not a live race —
   isolated worktrees prevent clobbering.

4. **Wait for all tasks in the wave to complete** before starting the next wave.

### TDD-gated merge — main agent, no human per task

For each completed task worktree, the main agent:

1. **Runs the task's tests before merge** (on the main branch): baseline must
   pass (or the relevant tests must be absent — the task adds them).
2. **Merges the worktree branch** into the main branch:

   ```bash
   git merge --no-ff agent/<task-id>
   ```

3. **Runs the task's tests after merge**: they must pass. If they do not, the
   merge is reverted and the task agent is given the failure output to fix.
4. **Removes the worktree** once the merge is accepted:

   ```bash
   git worktree remove ../worktrees/agent-<task-id>
   ```

The human does **not** review individual task merges. Per-task acceptance is
the main agent's responsibility — the TDD gate (tests pass before AND after
merge) plus the task's acceptance criteria. This mirrors the non-authoritative
working state pattern of the Human Review Loop (#17): per-task merge records
are uncommitted working state; the authoritative human gate is the final PR.

Advance to the next wave only after all tasks in the current wave are merged
and their tests pass.

### Human gate 3 — the final PR

Once all waves are merged and the full test suite passes, the main agent opens
a PR via the `cicd` skill (`devex pr open`). The human reviews and merges. This
is the last and only remaining human gate.

## After the final PR — summarize the delivery

Once the final PR is **merged**, close the execution loop cleanly instead of
stopping at a green merge:

1. **Summarize the delivery.** Run the sibling **`/summarize-delivery`** skill —
   the delivery-side closure leg. It turns the run into a committed
   accountability artifact (`docs/deliveries/<created-date>-<slug>.md`) that
   records planned-versus-actual delivery, the mid-work decisions the workforce
   made, where execution drifted from the plan, evidence-backed delivery claims
   (a claim without evidence stays `unverified`, never asserted as done), and
   any remaining work. The `devague plan waves --json` payload you fanned out is
   the planned-work baseline it compares actuals against.
2. **It closes partial and failed runs too.** `/summarize-delivery` does not
   require every wave to have merged — a run that shipped only some tasks, or
   none, still produces a truthful artifact: the failure lands under drift and
   remaining work, and no claim says done without evidence.

This is the accountability wrap-up after the three gates, not a fourth gate —
`/summarize-delivery` is method-only and read-only (#20): it summarizes the run,
it does not orchestrate, gate merges, or mutate devague state. Don't stop at
"PR merged" — the standing flow is **merge, then `/summarize-delivery`**.

## Hard rules (do not violate)

These protect the human-gate contract and the TDD guarantee.

- **Present the split plan before any fan-out.** Never spawn a task agent
  without prior human approval of the implementation split plan (gate 2). The
  split plan is the human's only implementation-stage decision.
- **One worktree per task.** Never run two tasks in the same worktree — file
  contention is managed by isolation, not by trust in the dependency graph.
  The dependency graph guarantees *logical* independence within a wave, not
  *file* disjointness. Conflicts surface at merge time.
- **Tests before AND after merge — no exceptions.** The TDD gate must pass on
  both sides. A merge that makes tests pass only after (not before) means the
  baseline was already broken — fix the baseline first.
- **Human does not gate per-task merges.** The TDD contract replaces the
  human here. Do not pause for human approval between wave tasks.
- **devague CLI is not orchestrated.** `devague plan waves` is read-only
  scheduling metadata (#20). Never run `devague plan` commands inside a task
  worktree to "mark a task done" or modify plan state from a subagent.
- **Three gates only.** The human's gates are: (1) the exported spec, (2) the
  implementation split plan, (3) the final PR. No silent fourth gate.
- **No LLM calls in the devague CLI.** The CLI is deterministic. This skill
  adds orchestration convention, not CLI behavior.

## Output contract

The `split-plan` subcommand prints to **stdout** and exits 0 when a converged
plan is found. On error (no plan, cyclic graph) it exits non-zero with a
`hint:` line on stderr. The `waves` subcommand forwards the CLI's own output
contract (stdout, `--json` for structured output, exit 0 on success).

The trailing End state section (#70) never fails `split-plan`: on a `devague`
new enough to have `plan deliverables`, it quotes that command's stdout
verbatim under an `End state (from \`devague plan deliverables\`):` header; on
an older `devague`, it prints exactly one hint line naming the minimum version
(e.g. `hint: End state view requires devague >= 0.18.0 (devague plan
deliverables)`) and `split-plan` still exits 0.

## Worked example

Picking up after `/spec-to-plan` exported a plan for the frame `my-feature`:

```bash
a() { bash .claude/skills/assign-to-workforce/scripts/assign-to-workforce.sh "$@"; }

# 1. Inspect the waves
a waves

# 2. Present the implementation split plan for human review
a split-plan

# --- HUMAN: review the table, edit agent/model assignments if needed,
#     then say "approved" to proceed ---

# 3. Fan out wave 1 (t1, t2, t3 are independent — run in parallel)
git worktree add ../worktrees/agent-t1 -b agent/t1
git worktree add ../worktrees/agent-t2 -b agent/t2
git worktree add ../worktrees/agent-t3 -b agent/t3
# ... spawn task agents in each worktree, await completion ...

# 4. TDD-gated merge for each wave-1 task (no human per task)
git merge --no-ff agent/t1   # tests pass before + after
git worktree remove ../worktrees/agent-t1
git merge --no-ff agent/t2
git worktree remove ../worktrees/agent-t2
git merge --no-ff agent/t3
git worktree remove ../worktrees/agent-t3

# 5. Advance to wave 2 (t4 depends on t1–t3 being merged)
git worktree add ../worktrees/agent-t4 -b agent/t4
# ... spawn, await, merge with TDD gate, remove worktree ...

# 6. Open the final PR (human gate 3)
bash .claude/skills/cicd/scripts/workflow.sh open
```

`devague plan waves --json` is the standing brief for each task agent — its
task id, summary, instruction, acceptance criteria, and the targets it covers
are all in that one payload. Quote those fields **verbatim** into each task
agent's brief; the fan-out is honest only if what the subagent builds against
is exactly what the user confirmed in the plan.

## Provenance

This is a **first-party** skill — its origin is `agentculture/devague`, where
the devague agent maintains it alongside the tools it operates (dogfooding),
next to its siblings `/think` and `/spec-to-plan`. It is the *third* skill in
that outbound family, covering the implementation leg after a plan converges.
The flow runs the *opposite* direction of the vendored guildmaster skills:
guildmaster pulls this **from** devague and broadcasts it to the rest of the
AgentCulture mesh. The `cite, don't import` policy still holds: downstream repos copy it,
they don't symlink or depend on it. See `docs/skill-sources.md`.
